.B Copy and Paste
By default dvtm captures mouse events to provide the actions listed below. Unfortunately
this interferes with the standard X copy and paste mechanism. To work around this
you need to hold down SHIFT while selecting or pasting text. Alternatively you can
disable mouse support at compile time, or use Mod\-M to toggle mouse support dynamically.

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
dvtm is customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
